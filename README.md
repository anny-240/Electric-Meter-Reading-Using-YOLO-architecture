# Electric-Meter-Reading-Using-YOLO-architecture
Accurate electric meter reading is crucial for efficient energy management and billing processes. This paper introduces a comprehensive approach to automatic meter reading, leveraging the YOLOv8 model for meter display extraction and evaluating various YOLO architectures for digit recognition. Through extensive experimentation, I demonstrate that YOLOv10 achieves the highest accuracy and efficiency.
